Complete Guide to SKAN 4.0: Transitioning from SKAN 3.0 and Optimizing Marketing Strategies for Gaming Companies

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between SKAN 3.0 and SKAN 4.0, the implications for gaming marketers, and actionable steps to optimize marketing strategies using SKAN 4.0 data.
It also highlights key concepts like crowd anonymity, source identifiers, lookback windows, and lock-in periods, and explains how to effectively use SKAN 4.0 to improve metrics like CAC, ROAS, and LTV.

Gaming marketers must prepare for the switch to SKAN 4.0, as it offers significant advantages over SKAN 3.0. Tools like Singular allow backward compatibility, enabling a smooth transition.

Key Differences Between SKAN 3.0 and SKAN 4.0
1. Crowd Anonymity and Source Identifier
SKAN 3.0: Limited campaign ID (2 bits, 4 values) and fixed privacy thresholds.

SKAN 4.0: Introduces Crowd Anonymity, which determines data granularity based on install volume. Higher installs = more data.

Source Identifier: Expanded to 4 bits (16 values), allowing more granular campaign tracking (e.g., campaign ID, ad set, geo, placement).

Data Tiers:

Tier 3 (High Crowd Anonymity): Full 4-digit source identifier and 64 fine-grained conversion values.

Tier 1 (Low Crowd Anonymity): Minimal data (2-digit source identifier, 3 coarse conversion values).

2. Multiple Postbacks
SKAN 3.0: Single postback after 24 hours.

SKAN 4.0: Three postbacks over different time windows:

Postback 1: 0-2 days (most data-rich).

Postback 2: 3-7 days (coarse data, 3 values).

Postback 3: 8-35 days (coarse data, 3 values).

Impact: Enables tracking of long-term user behavior and better LTV estimation.

##3. Lookback Windows
SKAN 3.0: Fixed 24-hour lookback window.

SKAN 4.0: Extends up to 35 days, allowing attribution of installs to older ad interactions.

Use Case: Useful for retargeting and measuring long-term campaign effectiveness.

4. Conversion Value Locking
SKAN 3.0: Conversion values could only increase.

SKAN 4.0: Conversion values can increase or decrease, providing flexibility to reflect user behavior more accurately.

Use Case: Helps differentiate between high-value and low-value users (e.g., subscribers vs. trial cancellers).

5. Random Delivery Delays
SKAN 4.0: Postbacks are delayed by random timers to protect privacy:

Postback 1: 1-2 days.

Postback 2: 1-6 days.

Postback 3: 1-6 days.

Impact: Creates challenges for cohort measurement but ensures privacy compliance.

6. Web-to-App Support
SKAN 4.0: Introduces support for web-to-app attribution via Safari, enabling cheaper web ad campaigns and richer onboarding experiences.

What Changes Do Gaming Marketers Need to Make?
1. Optimize Campaign Structure
Action: Consolidate smaller campaigns to achieve higher crowd anonymity and access more granular data.

Benefit: Better campaign optimization and more accurate attribution.

2. Leverage Hierarchical Conversion Values
Action: Use coarse-grained data for quick decision-making and fine-grained data for detailed optimization.

Benefit: Improved understanding of user engagement and revenue potential.

3. Plan for Multiple Postbacks
Action: Align conversion values with key user actions (e.g., level completion, in-app purchases) across all three postback windows.

Benefit: Better tracking of long-term user behavior and LTV.

4. Monitor Crowd Anonymity Thresholds
Action: Ensure campaigns generate sufficient install volume to achieve higher data tiers.

Benefit: Access to more detailed source identifiers and conversion values.

5. Avoid Conversion Locking
Action: Stick to standard postback windows instead of locking conversion values early.

Benefit: More accurate cohort measurement and better campaign evaluation.

How SKAN 4.0 Impacts Marketing Metrics
1. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
Impact: More granular data helps attribute costs to specific campaigns, improving CAC calculations.

Action: Use Tier 3 data to identify high-performing campaigns and optimize spend.

2. ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
Impact: Multiple postbacks enable tracking of revenue over longer periods, improving ROAS accuracy.

Action: Focus on campaigns with high post-install engagement and revenue potential.

3. LTV (Lifetime Value)
Impact: Extended lookback windows and multiple postbacks provide better insights into long-term user behavior.

Action: Use Postback 3 (8-35 days) to measure retention and LTV.

How to Effectively Use SKAN 4.0 Data
1. Set Clear Goals
Define success metrics (e.g., installs, in-app purchases, retention).

Align conversion values with these goals.

2. Use Advanced Analytics Tools
Leverage MMPs like Singular to decode SKAN 4.0 data and enrich it with first-party insights.

Use predictive modeling to estimate LTV and ROAS.

3. Test and Iterate
Continuously test different campaign strategies and analyze SKAN 4.0 data to identify trends.

Iterate based on insights to improve performance.

4. Educate Your Team
Train your marketing and data teams to interpret SKAN 4.0 data and understand its limitations.

Preparing for the SKAN 3.0 to SKAN 4.0 Transition
1. Update Your SDK
Ensure your app uses the latest version of the Singular SDK (or your chosen MMP) to support SKAN 4.0.

2. Collaborate with Ad Partners
Confirm their SKAN 4.0 readiness and share your source identifier hierarchies for better campaign optimization.

3. Plan Your Conversion Value Strategy
Align coarse and fine conversion values to ensure coherent and actionable data.

4. Build a Framework for Postback Analysis
Evaluate user behavior at each postback stage (D1, D7, D35) to measure engagement and revenue.

5. Decide on Conversion Locking
Avoid early conversion locking to ensure accurate cohort measurement.
