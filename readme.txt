Summary:
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to  SKAN 3.0 to SKAN 4.0 for marketing strategies in gaming companies. It highlights the key differences between SKAN 3.0 and SKAN 4.0, such as multiple postbacks, crowd anonymity, extended lookback windows, and flexible conversion values.

Explanation of the Workflow of Prediction models:
1. Synthetic Data Generation
Generates a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples.

Includes features like source_identifier, coarse_conversion, revenue, engagement, install_volume, ad_spend, and postback data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handles missing values.

Encodes categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Normalizes numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering
Aggregates postback revenue and engagement.

Adds crowd_anonymity_tier and days_since_install features.

4. Prepare Data for Modeling
Defines target variables: CAC, ROAS, and LTV.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

5. Train Models
Uses Random Forest for CAC prediction.

Uses XGBoost for ROAS and LTV predictions.

6. Evaluate Models
Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
